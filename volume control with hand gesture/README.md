Welcome To This HAND GESTURE DETECTION AND RECOGINITION SYSTEM Python-Project

Introduction

	Gesture recognition helps computers to understandhuman body language. This helps to build a morepotent link between humans and machines, ratherthan just the basic text user interfaces or graphicauser interfaces (GUIs). In this project for gestureRecognition, the human bodyâ€™s motions are read bycomputer camera. The computer then makes use ofthis data as input to handle applications. Theobjective of this project is to develop an interfacewhich will capture human hand gesturedynamically and will control the volume level .
